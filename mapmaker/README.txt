This is the original Map Maker application for the project which is deprecated as of 0.6.0.

All future versions of the Map Maker will be maintained here:

The latest build of the Map Maker can be accessed online here:

The original GX Map Maker was built using the InForm project as a base for the UI.
After the split in the QB64 community and the subsequent development, the original
InForm application will no longer build in the QB64PE fork.
Rather than maintain multiple InForm versions, and to take advantage of additional
advanced UI features, the decision was made to port the MapMaker to QBJS and remove
the Inform dependency.
